## Getting Started

You can open index.html directly into a browser to run the program. Provided files are the necessary CSS, and Javascript file to make the program work. Index.html should be opened with the javascript and CSS in the same directory, or functionality may be lost.

## Development

- The navigation menu is built dynamically with Javascript. In testing, A new section was added to check if the navigation menu expands automatically as it should.
- The navigation menu contains links to the correct sections.
- A click on a section in the navigation bar triggers smooth scroll to anchor ID.
- A section that is in the viewport is differentiated by animation.
- When hovering over a link in the nav bar it is highlighted in the color white.
